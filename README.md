## Project Description: Analyzing Netflix Data with Amazon QuickSight
### Overview
In this project, I’m exploring how to use Amazon QuickSight to analyze Netflix data and create visual dashboards. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with cloud-based data visualization tools while uncovering trends and insights from the dataset. This project is part of my journey to learn cloud data services for data analysis.

### Uploading Data to S3 for QuickSight

In this step, I’m setting up an S3 bucket on AWS to store the Netflix data files. I will:

1)Create a new S3 bucket

2)Upload the CSV files I want to analyze

3)Optionally update one of the uploaded files to ensure it's ready for QuickSight.

These files will serve as the data source for my analysis and visualizations in Amazon QuickSight.
